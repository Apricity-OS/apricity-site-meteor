You've already found out that using SSBs instantly turns anyone's computer into a super powerful hybrid machine.  I think that your users will very quickly learn to appreciate the power of this simple app.  It truly adds another level of freedom that, non ICE distros can't offer their users.  With the growth of the Cloud and its importance to both businesses and the home user.  It's imperative that Linux Desktop Distros offer simple Cloud integration for their users.  If they don't, they're going to be left behind and eventually become irrelevant.  ICE provides this integration.\r\n\r\nI've been using Peppermint for several years.  Our ICE application was made available in 2010.  Google's Chromebooks were still in beta in 2011.  This is a great example of Linux leading the way with this technology.  Having your favourite URLs open in an SSB is so convenient and simple.  It's the logical way to open a web page and interact in the Cloud.  I'll take this opportunity to congratulate Team Apricity on a beautiful looking hybrid Arch based system.  Well done and I wish you every success with this bleeding edge hybrid distro.  \r\n\r\nAndy Mitchell\r\n(PeppermintOS Community Manager)", "name": "Congratulations Team Apricity!!"}, {"createdAt": "2015-07-30 01:33:40", "discussionId": "4", "username": "clintv", "category": "Installation", "body": "I first booted the ISO using a USB device and selected the option to 'Boot Apricity OS (x86_64)'.

I'm running Ubuntu, so I can easily dd. I couldn't get the image to boot no matter what I did, using all of the official methods and some unnoficial ones (Universal USB Installer...etc). Until I decided to dd and accidentally \"dd'ed\" an older .iso file, (08.2015) which booted perfectly. I thought what got it working was the dd and not the different file, so I rebooted, formatted the USB stick, deleted the 08.2015 iso file (for some stupid reason that I now regret, don't ask... -.-) and proceeded to dd the 09.2015 file. When I tried to boot I got the same problem that I was getting with all the other methods:\r\n\r\nBoot stuck on:\r\n\r\n    starting version 225\r\n\r\nJust that, no error message...

Until I stumbled upon Apricity, I was torn between Manjaro and Antergos, but neither were really \"doing it for me\".  You know?\r\n\r\nWell, now that I've found Apricity, I'm super happy with my set up.  I can tell a lot of time has been taken to make sure that it is both totally functional as well as esthetically pleasing for the using.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions, which I hope you'll be able to help me out with.\r\n\r\nMy first questions have to do with the asthetic nature of Apricity and some aspects that I believe go against the beauty that is Apricity.\r\n\r\n1a) When the computer boots up, the screen it goes to is totally fugly (no offence, I'm sure it's being worked on and not a high priority).  Is this screen Grub2 or Syslinux?  If it's Syslinux, how can I make it Grub2 instead?  \r\n\r\n1b) I'm also trying to get Grub-Customizer to work, and when I use \"yaourt grub-customizer\" it shows this error a rather unhelpful error.  I tried to save the \"yaourt\" command and its output as a log file, but it was over 1,700 pages long.  So I don't think I'll be posting that any time soon.\r\n\r\n1c) Is there a way to customize the boot-splash to something a little more engaging than the words \"Starting 227\"? It used to show some barely-visible dots, but that was really tame as well given how beautiful Apricity is as a whole!\r\n\r\nNow onto other aspects of the OS that I'd like some clarification of.\r\n\r\n2) Which is the Display Manager that's installed?  I'd also like to customize this a little bit more to my liking for when I log -out and back -in after making changes that require a Gnome restart or whatever.  If it's not LightDM, qingy or SLiM, how can I change to one of those instead?\r\n\r\n3) Of the File Managers I have tried I feel more of an affinity to Thunar than Apricity's built-in Nautilus.  How do I go about changing all of Apricity so that Thunar is the default when opening an external HDD, prompted to save by an application, and generally everything else that Nautilus would normally do.  I know this might sound blashomous, but to each their own, right?\r\n\r\n5) Is it safe to install other Desktop Environments with Apricity?  Specifically, I would really like to give Pantheon (especially since eOS was my favorite Ubunty-based distro before I discovered the wonderfully superior Arch-based distros), Budgie, Hawaii, Deepin,and Lumina a shot.  (You can read all about these on the Arch wiki here: http://bit.ly/1ORi9tu).  Will installing these do anything to my computer that cannot be undone afterwqard?  If so, I'll just stick with my awesome, cuztomized, Gnome Shell!\r\n\r\n6) How does one go about customizing a theme?  For example, my favorite color is purple, and while I really like \"xenlism : minimalism\", \"Elementary\" and \"Ceti\" but I'd like to edit them so their accent coloris purple instead of blue.  Is there a way to do this?\r\n\r\n7) Is there anything else you'd like to tell me before undertaking these endeavors?\r\n\r\n===== EDIT =====\r\n\r\nSorry, I forgot to include these next 2 question before I hit submit.  \r\n\r\n8) When in the login screen, I'm presented with 2 options.  Gnome-Shell and Gnome-Shell on Wayland.  Is there any reason I should use the Wayland one?  I've found that it doesn't really work as well as well as the standard Gnome-Shell version, especially my trackpad.\r\n\r\n9) Finally, I'd also like to know if there's a way in Gnome-Shell I can use another Settings Manager.  For instance, other Settings Managers have allowed me to fine-tune my trackpad in addition to providing much more comprehensive Power features.  Is there any way I can add this functionality to my system?\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any info you can provide as I'm learning my way around this awesome Arch-based distro!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!  \r\n\r\n~ Ev\r\n", "name": "Several Questions About Customizing My Apricity OS"}, {"createdAt": "2015-10-23 19:31:37", "discussionId": "195", "username": "joostlinux", "category": "Newbie Corner", "body": "At first, I installed Apricity OS because I love the interface!\r\nThen, I've been used to debian based systems for a while now.

I want to testing out apricity for possibly using on my wife's computer or my laptop.  Right now I'm testing it on a spare partition of my desktop first.  Unfortunately, it does seem to be friendly to already installed bootloaders.  I installed apricity on a separate partition (/sda3/) and since it wouldn't let me install without choosing a partition for the uefi bootloader (kept stalling at 91 or 92% installed), I tried making a new partition for that bootloader (on /sda8 at /boot/efi)  formated fat32).  That didn't work either (install just hung at 92%), but now my computer is looking to that new bootloader instead of my arch linux bootloader.

I've been running the November's one for the past couple of weeks and I love the theme and experience that the Apricity team is crafting here. The only problem is how unstable it is, which is quite amazing seeing how lots of others comments about the stability of the OS.\r\n\r\nI haven't done much tinkering, so I'm pretty sure it's not my fault. But having the computer often getting stuck in a hangup when I'm trying to open the settings or Geary or some other app from the dock. I haven't tried to troubleshoot it, a simple reboot has always fixed it. It could just be the dock's issue. There're still many corners to be polished. Therefore I wonder: in what direction is your team aiming to take the project? Are there going to be more work in constructing the unique GNOME experience? I feel like your theme really makes it come alive, but are you going to be creating custom extensions and having more of a direction in regards to the experience you want people to experience. I love gnome and what you guys are doing with it, but the focus on KDE and XFCE might spread you guys a bit too thin I worry. There's still no large community backing for you guys, so I wonder if focusing a bit more until you get more traction would make more sense. Of course I say that out of pure self-regard since I would love you to polish and fix the experience with gnome predominantly, but enough of me.\r\n\r\nAlright, so since I'm running the old beta, do I have to do a plain install or there's some process to update seamlessly?

This release brings us ever closer to a stable, bug-free version. As usual, these release notes will detail the changes made in this version of Apricity OS. However, they will also begin explaining the progress that has been made with respect to other editions. First, recent changes: this release brings several improvements to the default vim interface, improved Samba and MTP integration, and the inclusion of several community-contributed wallpapers in the default wallpaper set.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk about desktop environments.\r\n\r\nWhen we first released Apricity OS, GNOME was the obvious choice for a default desktop environment. GNOME is easy to use for a beginner, it's fairly customizable through its set of extensions and it can be made to complement the user\u2019s aesthetic needs. Which desktop environment to use for the second edition, however, is a little harder to decide. We ultimately decided on Cinnamon for a number of reasons. Our original idea was to use KDE, but Plasma 5 just isn't stable enough yet. We next turned to XFCE, but it doesn\u2019t look very polished and isn't very customizable. Briefly considering LXDE, Pantheon, Budgie and i3, we rejected them for a number of reasons. LXDE, like XFCE, isn't very polished, Pantheon and Budgie aren't customizable enough, and i3 isn't user-friendly enough. We will later create editions of Apricity OS with some or all of these desktop environments, but we believe that the second edition needs to follow the same philosophy as the first and appeal to a similar audience. <a href='http://apricityos.com/blog/?p=49&preview=true'>Here is a gallery</a> of screenshots from an internal alpha of the Cinnamon version; a similar alpha will soon be released publicly.\r\n\r\nIn other news, a huge overhaul of the site's front and back ends is coming within a few months, as is a merchandise section. Vote at this poll to help decide what types of products you want to see. Fun fact: today, January 27th, is the six month anniversary of the first ever Apricity OS release. As always, we hope that you will find this release easy and enjoyable to use.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe Apricity OS Team", "name": "Apricity OS 01.2016 Beta Release"}, {"createdAt": "2016-01-29 02:21:59", "discussionId": "471", "username": "ynnoswafu", "category": "Newbie Corner", "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have just installed Apricity 2.2.8 64 bit, works fine and no errors at all, but after some updates, systems says, something went wrong with the system, I still can log on to the log on screen but after this, my dock was gone. any idea how i will be able to restore it?

If you already have Windows installed in your pc, download and install this free software: EasyBCD http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/\r\nIt supports Windows 10 and it's a configurable Windows bootloader.\r\nBy installing it, you won't notice any difference to your System.\r\nIt just boots your Windows (for now).\r\n\r\n2. Create free unformatted space on your hard disk drive, for installing your ApricityOS.\r\n\r\n3. Run ApricityOS installer, follow the easy steps and when asked for the Partitioning scheme, choose a custom configuration.\r\nGRUB MUST be installed either on your /boot partition (if you choose to have one) or on your /system partition, according to your setup.\r\nDo NOT install GRUB in the MBR, as this will cancel the purpose of this Tutorial.\r\n\r\nNow, it is also a good time to create a seperate /home partition, which will carry your personal data and configurations, and will/can remain intact upon a system failure or a system re-installation.\r\n\r\n4. Take a note of your /boot or /system Partition CAPACITY and FILESYSTEM, eg: \"/system\" might look like this: /dev/sda5 [Ext4 40GB]\r\n(you will be needing this info later)\r\n\r\n5. Finish with the rest of installation process, as you would normally do and Restart.\r\n\r\n6. Upon Restart, you will be presented with Windows operating system only.\r\nDon't worry, your brand new ApricityOS is there, hidden, waiting patiently for you.\r\n\r\n7. Now, you need to create an entry and point the EasyBCD Windows bootloader to the Partition you installed GRUB before.\r\n\r\nRun the \u201cEasyBCD\u201d program.\r\nGo to:\r\n\u201cAdd New Entry\u201d > \u201cLinux/BSD\u201d > \u201cType\u201d > choose GRUB2 > \u201cName\u201d > ApricityOS > \u201cDrive\u201d > choose the Partition you took note of, when you were installing ApricityOS.\r\nFrom the list you see, it is the \u201cLinux\u201d partition, with a capacity of \u201c40GB\u201d (according to my example - yours might differ)\r\nNot NTFS partition, Not SWAP partition.\r\nNow, save/apply your changes and exit the program.\r\nThat's pretty much it.\r\n\r\nUpon next restart, you'll be presented with a choice of running Windows or ApricityOS (Using the EasyBCD Bootloader).\r\nIf you choose ApricityOS, EasyBCD bootloader will redirect you to GRUB.\r\nFrom there onwards, it's the same as usual.\r\n\r\nThere is a downside to this.\r\nStarting your Linux system using a chain of Bootloaders, is time-consuming.\r\nYou can edit the waiting-time of EasyBCD bootloader from the EasyBCD program in Windows, as you can also edit the time GRUB waits untill starts booting, from your Linux system.\r\nA \u201c2\u201d seconds delay in both bootloaders is almost not noticeable.\r\n\r\nI have been using this setup for over a year now, and i consider it highly advantageous compared to just having GRUB managing my systems.\r\nPlus, for those people that are Dual-Booting, distro-hopping and want to run various linux distros in the normal way (not through Virtualization) this is the ultimate solution.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the EasyBCD bootloader fails?\r\nAs with a GRUB failure, you need to solve this issue yourselves.\r\nFix MBR from Windows installation media (GUI) or use their included command line tools.\r\nMaybe even re-install Windows if needed.\r\nIt really depends on your priorities.\r\n\r\nTreat Bootloaders nicely and they'll respect you.\r\nThey are NOT the part of your system, to be playing with.\r\n\r\nPS: EasyBCD is an EXTREMELY powerful program.\r\nIt can turn your Dual-Booting experience into a Dream or a Nightmare.\r\nDo NOT apply changes in the Booting Order carelessly, as they might and WILL destroy your Booting process.\r\nBe very CAUTIOUS when DELETING a Boot Entry.\r\nMaybe you should even avoid doing this, since you can install a new Linux distro, where your old one was, using the same configuration on the Partitioning Scheme (Very Handy) and using exactly the same configuration on the EasyBCD program (no need to change anything -that is-)\r\nEasyBCD program is NOT \u201csystem-specific\u201d when it comes to Linux Operating Systems.\r\nIt is only \u201cPartition-specific\u201d.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n", "name": "[Dual-Booting / The \u201cOther\u201d Way]"}, {"createdAt": "2016-02-06 00:45:44", "discussionId": "492", "username": "elr77", "category": "Newbie Corner", "body": "Hi just wondering if anyone has tried installing the Linux-vfio-lts package? \r\nI have been trying to but it kept getting into a \"do you want to restart installation loop\" under the package installer. \r\nIt refuses to verify integrity and aborts the install each time in terminal.

Other improvements to the operating system include updates to dozens of packages including the terminal (better transparency), Nautilus (Google Drive support), MTP, Pamac (several new features, support for the latest version of Pacman), and Totem (support for more codecs). Additionally, Apricity is now using version 2.0 of Calamares, the installer, which should improve overall stability during the installation process.

Apricity OS 04.2016 Beta is being released alongside Apricity OS 04.2016 RC1. This month, a lot of effort has gone into improving the development workflow and making a distinction between stable, tested features and untested features. The apricity-core repository has split into three seperate repositories: the standard, unsigned apricity-core repo, a new signed apricity-core repo, and a signed apricity-core-dev repository for developers. All three repos are now being built twice a week. On the github side of things, almost all repositories have moved onto a new branching model. Repositories on this branching model have at least two branches: dev, and master. Feature branches are merged into dev when they are more-or-less finished. Master is considered the stable branch, and dev, as its name suggests, is for development. New features should be built on seperate feature-* branches, releases will be developed on release-* branches, and hotfixes for production code will be built on hotfix-* branches. Both versions of stable apricity-core now build packages from the master branches, and apricity-core-dev builds from dev branches. In terms of the OS itself, not much has changed. Many bugs with the installer have been fixed, more mouse/touchpad drivers are being included by default, and many apricity-* packages have received bugfixes. Autologin for the Gnome edition has been fixed. A particularly annoying bug where the Apricity Icons iconset threw warnings about missing size fields has (finally) been fixed. As an aside, Apricity recently passed 100,000 downloads! Thanks to everyone who helped us reach this milestone.\r\n\r\nAs always, we hope you will find this release easy and enjoyable to use.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe Apricity OS Team", "name": "Apricity OS 04.2016 Beta & RC1 Release"}, {"createdAt": "2016-05-02 04:43:22", "discussionId": "725", "username": "lerner17", "category": "Hardware Support", "body": "Not sure if this should go into gaming or hardware, so please move as appropriate...\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I opened up steam  and I decided to play a game tonight.

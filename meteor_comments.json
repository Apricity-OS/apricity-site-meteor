The idea is that with Apricity OS, you can install it once and never again have to look at an Apricity iso, live image, or installer. We also chose Arch Linux because of the AUR, which gives Arch Linux a uniquely centralized repository for everything that's not in the official ones. Additionally, because we use the official Arch Linux repositories, we have access to the huge community of testers and troubleshooters that make sure packages are actually stable and can actually be upgraded without fear of breaking something. That said, it is still important to update regularly, as if a system falls too far behind, it does become more likely that even a thoroughly tested package may break something, as unstable packages are usually tested on up-to-date systems. This is why the Pamac graphical package manager and updater checks for updates so frequently and pushes update notifications as soon as there's any update available.

Eventually, seeing how much work it took to make said iso, we decided to polish it a little bit and publish it. The name \"Apricity\" means \"The Warmth of the Sun on a Winter Day\". Its etymology has to do with wishing for April while it's still cold out. Myself and one other team member were looking for depreciated yet beautiful-sounding words when we stumbled upon \"Apricity\". We didn't decide then-and-there to name the project Apricity OS, but we did tentatively start calling it that and the name just stuck (especially after we made the wordmark). Our goal is to create an operating system that works really well out of the box, looks good enough to steal people from Apple and Microsoft, supports the widest possible range of regularly updated apps (hence the Arch Linux base), and has great support for Windows apps as soon as you install it. We also want to help people use their favorite web apps more easily, which is why we included ICE.

To test that, you can do one of two things. First, you can just reboot and see if the GDM login screen also has a weird aspect ratio. Alternatively, you can install the xfce4 group, then reboot and, after selecting your user but before entering your password, select XFCE from the cog wheel dropdown menu.

Find your main Windows partition, right click it, and select resize. You should resize it by the amount of space you want to dedicate to Apricity (10Gb minimum).\r\n\r\n3.

Use USBWriter to write the Apricity ISO to your flash drive. Be careful here: you don't want to accidentally write it to the wrong storage device. \r\n\r\n7. Boot into that USB device.\r\n\r\n8. Follow the instructions given by the installer to select your language, keymap, etc. \r\n\r\n9.

Many thanks for a wonderful work you have done. \r\n\r\nI do feel the need to say a few words as a desktop user about the different desktop environments you have talked about. I  have found KDE Plazma bloated and had a feeling it is getting in the way. I have tried LXQt briefly but customization proved to be too difficult for me as an ordinary user. Pantheon looks nice but the problem with Pantheon is the heavy reliance on Ubuntu and Unity, making it hard to port it to other Linux distributions. In fact no other distribution uses Pantheon but the origin Elementary OS.  Budgie is also difficult to customize and i3 is a very specific environment for a specific user.\r\n\r\nHowever I have found XFCE to be light enough and still allow a solid level of customization, again speaking from a basic desktop use. It does look a bit basic and plain in default but can be turned into almost anything.\r\nFor example Crome OS\r\nhttp://linuxthemer.blogspot.rs/2014/06/make-xfce-look-like-chromeos-part-2.html\r\nOr Pantheon\r\nhttp://clavicus14.deviantart.com/art/XFCE-meets-Pantheon-268871644\r\n\r\nSo if I may suggest XFCE for the next DE and in the pipeline I guess you will have to think about a Qt based DE too.\r\n", "username": "Tiron"}, {"createdAt": "2016-02-01 19:00:15", "discussionId": "478", "body": "Is it possible?\r\nThe answer is YES.\r\n\r\nWhat You Need:\r\n1.

It seems that even though pacaur and yaourt, (even package manager before the system upgrade broke the gui) found the files it seemed like the links were out of date or just plain wrongly configured in the Archlinux AUR. \r\n\r\nTo resolve the problem,\r\n1: I edited my pacman.conf file using the command \r\nsudo gedit /etc/pacman.conf\r\n\r\n2: add the direct link to markzz's personal repo to my pacman.conf file. So basically added The following lines\r\n\r\n[markzz]\r\nSigLevel=Never\r\nSource= Http://repo.markzz.com/arch/markzz/x86_64\r\n\r\n3: ran the install using the command\r\nsudo pacaur -Syu Linux-vfio \r\n\r\nAnd it installed.\r\n\r\nTo get the correct link to the repo I had to reverse engineer my way back up to the parent directory of one of the broken links on the Archlinux AUR wiki. The odd part of the whole experience is that packages are on AUR but for whatever reason the links to them are not properly updated or passed properly on to the mirror lists in my ApricityOS install. However I suspect it is a wider issue with the Archlinux AUR that is not noticed because most people continue to dual boot and not realize that they can potentially avoid that by using vga/PCIe pass through or realize that it is actually a possibility especially now that cpu cores are increasing and most Intel and AMD CPUs come with the support built in.\r\nAnyway the solution described above has worked for me and the link to the repo is correct as of the time I'm writing this.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to do the VGA pass through in KVM to avoid dual booting, the instructions I am following are on \r\n\r\nhttp://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/how-to-setup-a-gaming-virtual-machine-with-gpu-passthrough-qemu-kvm-libvirt-and-vfio.1371980/\r\n\r\nYou just need to make sure you have 2 GPUs from different companies and your cpu and motherboard support vt-d or iommu.

I installed Apricity yesterday, I am a total noob regarding Arch, and I'm stuck at this issue. Here's what I would like to be helped with; see what you can do for me:\r\n\r\n1) I ran 'pacman -S --needed base-devel' on the terminal and I got a list of all member of this group. Based on what's written on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages I think that means I don't have any of them installed. In fact, I did try to run 'makepkg -sri' as marquitusus instructed and I got an error message saying PKGBUILD doesn't exist. Bottom line: how do I install all the base level members?\r\n\r\n2) Marquitusus step-by-step list above concerns the installation of the pamac-aur package, and this is what we have to use whenever we want to install something while pamac is down, correct? On step 4, can I extract the file to wherever I want? On step 5, simply double click on the extracted folder and then open the terminal?\r\n\r\n3) To build a package, all I need to do is 'makepkg -sri'?\r\n\r\nI really want to install a couple tar.gz files (Abiword and Gnumeric), so if it's too much to ask, help with this process would be highly welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nGui", "username": "gecmartins"}, {"createdAt": "2016-02-09 18:19:45", "discussionId": "481", "body": "Hi gecmartins, I'll try to answer:\r\n\r\n1- After you see the list of all members of group, just hit \"enter\" and you'll install all of them.

You can extract the file wherever you want, maybe is better in a non protected folder, for example \"Documents\" or something like that. On step 5, you double click the downloaded *.tar.gz file will open the extraction tool. Just click \"extract\", up-left corner, and say to it to which folder you want to extract it.

I have read stuff about mkinitcpio.conf, lvm, encryption and tried many configuration modification without succeeding.  \r\n\r\nI need help ! \r\n\r\nHere are my main info :\r\n/etc/crypttab\r\nroot UUID=c178929d-e5c4-4230-9bec-afae9df6dda5 none luks,timeout=180\r\n\r\n/etc/fstab\r\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--gnome--vg-root /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\r\nUUID=34e807ea-b3d1-471c-b485-56671deeb532 /boot           ext2    defaults        0       2\r\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--gnome--vg-swap_1 none            swap    sw              0       0\r\n\r\nI have modified that line on my /etc/default/grub\r\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"splash cryptdevice=/dev/ubuntu--gnome--vg/root root=/dev/mapper/root resume=UUID=b998eeee-b8de-45ff-af3e-be\r\nbe211ee198\"\r\n\r\nI have changed this line in the\r\n/etc/mkinitcpio.conf\r\nHOOKS=\"base udev modconf keyboard keymap plymouth block encrypt lvm2 resume filesystems fsck\"\r\n\r\n\r\npvdisplay\r\n  --- Physical volume ---\r\n  PV Name               /dev/mapper/luks-c178929d-e5c4-4230-9bec-afae9df6dda5\r\n  VG Name               ubuntu-gnome-vg\r\n  PV Size               698,40 GiB / not usable 0   \r\n  Allocatable           yes (but full)\r\n  PE Size               4,00 MiB\r\n  Total PE              178789\r\n  Free PE               0\r\n  Allocated PE          178789\r\n  PV UUID               4p56Zz-YDJl-gmBY-dc9w-JGuk-MBzr-1nqOMW\r\n\r\nlvdisplay\r\n --- Logical volume ---\r\n  LV Path                /dev/ubuntu-gnome-vg/root\r\n  LV Name                root\r\n  VG Name                ubuntu-gnome-vg\r\n  LV UUID                dsTq7N-eS1S-iCuL-WdF3-ICPS-9tLm-85ryQq\r\n  LV Write Access        read/write\r\n  LV Creation host, time ubuntu-gnome, 2016-01-27 22:35:40 -0500\r\n  LV Status              available\r\n  # open                 1\r\n  LV Size                692,91 GiB\r\n  Current LE             177386\r\n  Segments               1\r\n  Allocation             inherit\r\n  Read ahead sectors     auto\r\n  - currently set to     256\r\n  Block device           254:1\r\n   \r\n  --- Logical volume ---\r\n  LV Path                /dev/ubuntu-gnome-vg/swap_1\r\n  LV Name                swap_1\r\n  VG Name                ubuntu-gnome-vg\r\n  LV UUID                4AwCRw-vRF2-d2tG-w16R-lbOi-OGlH-qE4dUh\r\n  LV Write Access        read/write\r\n  LV Creation host, time ubuntu-gnome, 2016-01-27 22:35:41 -0500\r\n  LV Status              available\r\n  # open                 0\r\n  LV Size                5,48 GiB\r\n  Current LE             1403\r\n  Segments               1\r\n  Allocation             inherit\r\n  Read ahead sectors     auto\r\n  - currently set to     256\r\n  Block device           254:2\r\n\r\nOutput from blkid:\r\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"34e807ea-b3d1-471c-b485-56671deeb532\" TYPE=\"ext2\" PARTUUID=\"b8cccbc3-01\"\r\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"c178929d-e5c4-4230-9bec-afae9df6dda5\" TYPE=\"crypto_LUKS\" PARTUUID=\"b8cccbc3-05\"\r\n/dev/mapper/luks-c178929d-e5c4-4230-9bec-afae9df6dda5: UUID=\"4p56Zz-YDJl-gmBY-dc9w-JGuk-MBzr-1nqOMW\" TYPE=\"LVM2_member\"\r\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--gnome--vg-root: UUID=\"20c1469b-ab21-4385-bd75-16c3b9ae1cc7\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\r\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--gnome--vg-swap_1: UUID=\"a2f748d4-18d6-4662-8759-c172eab16ffd\" TYPE=\"swap\"\r\n\r\nOutput from lsblk\r\nNAME                                          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT\r\nsda                                             8:0    0 698,7G  0 disk  \r\n\u251c\u2500sda1                                          8:1    0   243M  0 part  /boot\r\n\u251c\u2500sda2                                          8:2    0     1K  0 part  \r\n\u2514\u2500sda5                                          8:5    0 698,4G  0 part  \r\n  \u2514\u2500luks-c178929d-e5c4-4230-9bec-afae9df6dda5 254:0    0 698,4G  0 crypt \r\n    \u251c\u2500ubuntu--gnome--vg-root                  254:1    0 692,9G  0 lvm   /\r\n    \u2514\u2500ubuntu--gnome--vg-swap_1                254:2    0   5,5G  0 lvm   \r\n\r\n\r\nI have created the new initrd with :  mkinitcpio -p linux-lts\r\nI have updated the grub with :  grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\r\n\r\nThe system boot to grub, I can select apricity but then I have a screen with 3 or 4 yellow dot blinking and everything wait forever.

Extract them with this command that will work for most archives:\r\n$ bsdtar xvf foobar-cursor-theme.tar.gz --directory ~/.icons\r\nThe cursor theme directory structure is theme-name/cursors, for example: ~/.icons/theme/cursors/; make sure the extracted files follow this structure.\r\nNote: For system-wide installation the /usr/share/icons directory is used. Direct extraction to this directory is usually discouraged as files here are not tracked by pacman; it is recommended to create a package for the cursor theme instead.\r\nAlready installed cursor themes can be viewed with the command:\r\nfind /usr/share/icons ~/.icons -type d -name \"cursors\"\r\nIf the package includes an index.theme file, check if there is an \"Inherits\" line inside. If yes, check whether the inherited theme also exists on the system (rename if needed).\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to set the cursor theme.\r\nLXAppearance\r\nLXAppearance sets the default cursor by creating an index.theme file as specified in #XDG specification.\r\nXDG specification\r\nThis method applies to both X11 and Wayland cursor themes.\r\nFor user-specific configuration, create or edit ~/.icons/default/index.theme. For system-wide configuration, one can edit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme.\r\nDefine the theme directory name:\r\n~/.icons/default/index.theme\r\n[icon theme] \r\nInherits=theme-name\r\nWarning: Creating a symbolic link with ln -s /usr/share/icons/theme-name/ ~/.icons/default\r\nis not sufficient for a consistent cursor theme.\r\nThen, create a symbolic link to the respective cursor directory (in case of a system-wide theme):\r\nln -s /usr/share/icons/theme-name/cursors ~/.icons/default/cursors\r\nRe-login for the changes to take effect.\r\nDesktop environments\r\nDesktop environments use the XSETTINGS protocol, typically implemented through a settings daemon. While this allows to change the cursor on-the-fly, the applied theme may be inconsistent across applications. See #XDG specification to change the cursor theme manually.\r\nGNOME\r\nTo change the theme in GNOME, use gnome-tweak-tool or set the configuration directly with:\r\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme theme-name\r\nX resources\r\nTo locally name a cursor theme, add to the ~/.Xresources file:\r\nXcursor.theme: cursor-theme\r\nTo have the cursor theme properly loaded it will need to be done so by the window manager; if it does not, it can be forced to load prior the window manager by putting the following command in ~/.xinitrc or .xprofile (depending on ones personal setup):\r\n$ xrdb ~/.Xresources\r\nOptionally, add this line to ~/.Xresources if your cursor theme supports multiple sizes:\r\nXcursor.size: 16\r\nTip: 32, 48 or 64 may also be good size.\r\nIf in doubt over supported cursor sizes, start X without this setting and let it choose the cursor size automatically. (Refer to your window manager documentation for details.)\r\nEnvironment variable\r\nYou can use an environment variable to set a theme for a single application to try it out temporarily, for example:\r\n$ XCURSOR_THEME=SomeThemeName xclock\r\nXCURSOR_SIZE is optional if your cursor theme supports multiple sizes.\r\nDisplay managers\r\nCursor theme can usually be set within a display manager, but keep in mind the cursor theme may not carry over to the user session.\r\nGDM\r\nSee GDM#Changing the cursor theme.\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n\r\nCreate links to missing cursors\r\nApplications may keep using the default cursors when a theme lacks some cursors. This can be corrected by adding links to the missing cursors. For example:\r\n$ cd ~/.icons/theme/cursors/\r\n$ ln -s right_ptr arrow\r\n$ ln -s cross crosshair\r\n$ ln -s right_ptr draft_large\r\n$ ln -s right_ptr draft_small\r\n$ ln -s cross plus\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr top_left_arrow\r\n$ ln -s cross tcross\r\n$ ln -s hand hand1\r\n$ ln -s hand hand2\r\n$ ln -s left_side left_tee\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr ul_angle\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr ur_angle\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr_watch 08e8e1c95fe2fc01f976f1e063a24ccd\r\nIf the above does not solve the problem, look in /usr/share/icons/whiteglass/cursors for additional cursors your theme may be missing, and create links for these as well.\r\nTip: You can also remove unwanted cursors. To for example remove the \"watch\" cursor:\r\n$ cd ~/.icons/theme/cursors/\r\n$ rm watch left_ptr_watch\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr watch\r\n$ ln -s left_ptr left_ptr_watch\r\nSupplying missing cursors\r\nSome programs set their own custom cursors which you may want to override. A common example of this is rdesktop, which connects to a Microsoft Windows computer and uses the cursors obtained from the remote machine, which can often be difficult to see due to protocol limitations yielding poor conversion quality.\r\nThis can be resolved by replacing these cursors with ones from the same (or another) cursor theme. In order to do this, the hash of the image must be obtained. This is done by setting the XCURSOR_DISCOVER environment variable prior to launching the application that sets these cursors:\r\n$ XCURSOR_DISCOVER=1 rdesktop ...\r\nThe first time (and only the first time) the cursor is set, some details will be displayed, like this:\r\nCursor image name: 24020000002800000528000084810000\r\n...\r\nCursor image name: 7bf1cc07d310bf080118007e08fc30ff\r\n...\r\nCursor hash 24020000002800000528000084810000 returns 0x0\r\nWhen Xcursor looks for missing cursors, the search path includes ~/.icons/default/cursors so this is where an image can be placed for Xcursor to find. First, create this directory if it does not already exist:\r\n$ mkdir -p ~/.icons/default/cursors\r\nThen link the hash to the target image. Here we are using the left_ptr image from the Vanilla-DMZ cursor theme:\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/Vanilla-DMZ/cursors/left_ptr ~/.icons/default/cursors/24020000002800000528000084810000\r\nThe change will be visible as soon as the application is restarted. No special method of launching the application is required.\r\nrdesktop\r\nHere are some common Microsoft Windows cursors that rdesktop uses when connecting to a remote machine running Windows 7. Unfortunately animated cursors are difficult to override as they are sent frame-by-frame, so one mapping will be needed for every frame!\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/00000000017e000002fc000000000000 ~/.icons/default/cursors/xterm\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/00000093000010860000631100006609 ~/.icons/default/cursors/right_ptr\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/01e00000201c00004038000080300000 ~/.icons/default/cursors/plus\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/24020000002800000528000084810000 ~/.icons/default/cursors/left_ptr\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/6ce0180090108e0005814700a0021400 ~/.icons/default/cursors/left_ptr_watch\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/d2201000a2c622004385440041308800 ~/.icons/default/cursors/hand\r\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/$THEME/cursors/fc618c00da110f0034fd0e004e082400 ~/.icons/default/cursors/watch\r\nChange X shaped default cursor\r\nThe default X shaped Xcursor appears in window managers that do not set the default cursor to left_ptr or in window managers using XCB (like awesome) instead of Xlib.\r\nTo fix this simply add the following to your ~/.xinitrc , xsession or window managers startup configuration if possible (for example bspwm's bspwmrc).\r\n$ xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr&\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Cursor_themes&redirect=no", "username": "Darknife"}, {"createdAt": "2016-06-23 03:10:43", "discussionId": "669", "body": "He probado en mi Apricity y funciona, actualiza y verifica nuevamente si te funciona", "username": "Darknife"}, {"createdAt": "2016-06-23 03:12:38", "discussionId": "668", "body": "Update and check", "username": "Darknife"}, {"createdAt": "2016-06-23 04:34:39", "discussionId": "53", "body": "Well, I downloaded again and got different MD5's.

I am the one who posted that I had  Apricity installed on my Kangaroo pc about 7 months ago.Since then I have tried other distros on it  with Deepin OS being the current one. Recently, I did install the current gnome version of Apricity ( 130 ) but had some problems with the screen freezing  while using it. I have used Win32DI  and Unetbootin to install Apricity utilizing the entire disk; so it can be done. I assume that you have secure boot disabled in the Bios . Also, the Kangaroo has a 3.0 usb port and a 2.0 usb port. I believe that I have had, for some odd reason, more success  using the 2.0 port for installation.  The Kangaroo is rather fickle when trying to install Linux distros, for most(even the ones with UEFI support) will not install. I have had success installing Apricity, Linux Mint 17.3, Xubuntu 14.04, CubOS, and Deepin OS. Do you still have W10 installed? If so you may need to shrink the partition and create a 2nd ext.4 partition for Apricity. Hope I have helped a little. Maybe some other more experienced forum member can help you out.Oops, just remembered that the Apricity I just recently installed was not the 130 or most current version, but the January 2016 version, which,after installing, I performed the 1,200+  MB update to version 130.
